Association Rule Mining
A store is interested in determining the associations between items purchased from the Health and Beauty Aids department and the Stationery Department. The store chose to conduct a market basket analysis of specific items purchased from these two departments. TRANSACTIONS contains information about over 400,000 transactions made over the past three months. The following 17 products are represented in the data set: bar soap, bows, candy bars, deodorant, greeting cards, magazines, markers, pain relievers, pencils, pens, perfume, photo processing, prescription medications, shampoo, toothbrushes, toothpaste, and wrapping paper.
There are four variables in the data set:
Name	Model Role	Data Type	Description
STORE	Ignore	Numeric	Identification number of the store
TRANSACTION	Ident	Numeric	Transaction identification number
PRODUCT	Target	Categorical	Product purchased
QUANTITY	Ignore	Numeric	Quantity of this product purchased
